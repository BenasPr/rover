# Overview

**`roverctl` is a command-line interface (CLI) that provides you with everything you need to develop and work with ASE Rover services and pipelines. Interaction is based on an active `roverd` instance, which comes preinstalled on your Rover.**

## Features

With `roverctl` you can:

- Start `roverctl-web`, the complete web interface to manage and debug your Rover
- Initialize a new service in any supported language
- Synchronize your service development with your Rover while you work
- Build and validate pipelines composed out of one or multiple services
- Manage pipeline execution and view logs and details
- View information about your Rover
- SSH into your Rover quickly

`roverctl` runs on your own system and interacts with the public `roverd` REST API. To start `roverctl-web`, Docker needs to be installed.
